## Side Projects

### rust-cal

This is a quick project I built as part of my attempt to begin learning Rust. I thought it'd be fun to make a small utility program to display my university timetable in my terminal (since I am using my laptop throughout most of the day).

### Magna Karta - Royal Hackaway v7

At Royal Hackaway in Jan 2024, my team and I decided we wanted to try a hardware-based project for the first time. We thought about interesting things related to Egham, where the University of Royal Holloway is. Hence, the play on words "Magna Karta" (as Egham is where the Magna Carta was signed in 1215). 

Magna Karta was a small remote-controlled car built from cardboard, a Raspberry Pi and a dream. The idea was to make an autonomous buggy that would have working collision detection through the use of an ultrasonic sensor, whilst also displaying the words of the Magna Carta on an LCD screen.

The resulting product was not autonomous, and we instead had to remote control it ourselves, but we did successfully implement automatic braking using the ultrasonic sensor. If you want to read more, see our (somewhat delirious) [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/magna-karta)
